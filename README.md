This repository contains the information about the Virtual Machine (VM) that hosts the Research Link Australia (RLA) Graph. This graph is based on the National Graph database and the VM includes two version of the database:
- Neo4j database that enables the graph-based information retrival
- Typesense that provides text-indexed search

In addition, the VM hosts a Python based API that provide a demonstration of how combination of Neo4j and Typesense can work, and series of Jupyter Notebooks that describes some of the use cases.

The following links provide the initial required information to work with the VM.

* [System Requirements](vm-ng/system-requirements.md): This file contains the system requirements for the VM to run all the services.
* [Installation](vm-ng/installation.md): This file contains the installation and setup sets for Jenkins and Github.
* [Getting Started](vm-ng/getting-started.md): This file contains the step to run the Jupyter Notebooks.
